# 🚀 Backend Learning  

Welcome to my **Backend Learning Playground**! 🎉  
This repo is where I **break, fix, and build** while learning backend development.  
It’s like my personal **developer diary**, but with code, bugs 🐛, and lots of coffee ☕.  

Think of it as a fun theme park 🎢 where each folder is a different ride into the world of **Node.js & backend dev**.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  

Here’s how everything is organized now:  

| Folder | What’s inside | Emoji |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| `concepts/` | Small, bite-sized exercises to learn core topics (callbacks, promises, async/await, dotenv, etc.) | 🧩 |
| `projects/` | Mini-projects where I put everything together (Task Tracker, Blog API, etc.) | 🏗️ |

👉 **Concepts** = Learn the basics step by step.  
👉 **Projects** = Apply the basics in real(ish) scenarios.

## ✨ Examples of What You’ll Find  

### 🧩 Concepts
- **Callbacks vs Promises** → how JavaScript handles async stuff  
- **Async/Await** → writing async code without looking like spaghetti 🍝  
- **Custom dotenv** → building my own `.env` handler  
- **Express basics** → setting up a simple REST API  

### 🏗️ Projects
- **Task Tracker**  
  - CLI app to manage tasks (add, update, mark done ✅)  
  - Practice with Node.js filesystem and JSON storage  

- **Blog API** *(coming soon...)*  
  - REST API with Express  
  - CRUD for blog posts  
  - A playground for middlewares and routes

## 🌟 Fun Fact  

Every folder here is like a **checkpoint** in a video game 🎮.  
Each time I complete one, I unlock new powers 💪 as a future full-stack developer.
